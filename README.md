# TV Episode Recommendation System
A command line interface for recommending TV episodes based on ratings and keyword matching.

##How it works
The program reads from the *SHOWS* file, which contains structured data about each TV show it uses for its computations. 
The file is structured this way: ![alt text] img/example1.png

For example: ![alt text] img/example2.png

After all the necessary data has been included in the *SHOWS* file, the program is ready to be used.

The user is first greeted by a message, a short overview of the different commands, and a command prompt. 

* __quit__: Exit the program.
* __
* __load *show*__: Load a TV show into the program. 
* __top *n*__: List the top n episodes.
